Or him?  \r\nBut I seem to face the same people in every fight.  \r\n  \r\nIf only he knew that my thought then  \r\nDwelt upon that missing soul  \r\nI believe he would not have sought an  \r\nArgument to pierce another hole!  \r\n  \r\nA romance blessed by curses  \r\nWill end like Shakespeare's pair  \r\nIn the mind or from the mouth -  \r\nDestruction equally fair.  \r\n  \r\nThere are friends that are never meant to be  \r\nBlanca, Kyle and Kerry  \r\nAnd those are the friends of your best friends.  \r\nLife is short - neither let them be - nor worry.  \r\n",
