{"name":"Poetry","tagline":"by Cassandra Lee Yieng","body":"### 21 April 2009, 0059 -- 0431\r\nA glass of endless pain  \r\nA straw of sugar cane  \r\nA silver spoon stuck in a dune  \r\nOf muddy common grain.  \r\n***\r\n### 9 January 2013, 21:06\r\nCast into my bitter well  \r\nA wood which name I cannot spell  \r\nMay the waters gush forth sweet  \r\nAnd word spread forth that which is meet.  \r\n### \"There are friends that are never meant to be (1 October 2010)\"\r\nYou can't befriend some people  \r\nAnd somehow it does not seem right  \r\nIs there something wrong with me? Or him?  \r\nBut I seem to face the same people in every fight.  \r\n  \r\nIf only he knew that my thought then  \r\nDwelt upon that missing soul  \r\nI believe he would not have sought an  \r\nArgument to pierce another hole!  \r\n  \r\nA romance blessed by curses  \r\nWill end like Shakespeare's pair  \r\nIn the mind or from the mouth -  \r\nDestruction equally fair.  \r\n  \r\nThere are friends that are never meant to be  \r\nBlanca, Kyle and Kerry  \r\nAnd those are the friends of your best friends.  \r\nLife is short - neither let them be - nor worry.
